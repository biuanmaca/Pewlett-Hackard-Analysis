# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
UM Bootcamp Module 7

## Overview of Analysis
This analysis was to get an idea of the number of employees at Pewlett-Hackard who will be
retiring soon by job titles.  In addition it was to identify a list of employees who would
be eligible to participate in a mentorship program within the company.

## Results
The analysis of employees retiring soon gave us the following counts:

- Senior Engineers and Staff will make up around 64% of all employees expected to retire soon.
- Managers are the least affected group making up on 2 employees expected to retire soon.

With the mentorship program eligibility listing, we have determined the followin:
- 1,550 employees qualify to be a part of the mentorship program.
- 704 of them are either senior engineers or staff.

## Summary
In determining the risk for expected near-term retirmeent, we can ennumerate the potential for
90,398 positions to be vacated of which 64% will be senior enigineers and staff.  In order to 
replace the vacant positions, the mentorship program would have 1,550 employees eligible to 
mentor new hires.  Of those, 704 would be senior engineers and staff.  To fully replace the
retirees and train new hires, mentors would each need to take on approximately 58 new hires in
aggregate.  When looking just at the senior engineers and senior staff, they would need to take
on approximately 82 new hires per mentor.  These numbers indicate the Pewlett-Hackard is highly
exposed to risk due to expected retirements and the mentorship program alone will not be able
to fulfill the training of new hires.  Other strategies will need to be added to reduce our
risk exposure.
